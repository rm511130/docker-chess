# Docker-Chess

Let's run my Chess PHP App using Docker.

Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your Mac and follow the steps below:

```
Mac $ cd /work
Mac $ git clone https://github.com/rm511130/docker-chess
Mac $ cd docker-chess
Mac $ docker build . -t chess
Mac $ docker run -d --rm -p 8080:80 chess
```

Access the Chess App using a browser: http://127.0.0.1:8080

To stop the Docker Chess program, follow this example:

```
Mac $ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE  COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                 NAMES
1eaebd33e42b   chess  "docker-php-entrypoiâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  pedantic_yalow

Mac $ docker stop 1eaebd33e42b
```

# Now let's push the Docker image of Chess to the Docker Hub

These are the steps I executed to upload the Docker Chess App image to my Docker Hub repo:

```
Mac $ docker image tag chess rmeira/chess
Mac $ docker push rmeira/chess
```
```
The push refers to repository [docker.io/rmeira/chess]
